# Laws of UX — composition reference

Universal cognitive, perceptual, and behavioral heuristics that decide
**what a UI composes** — how many pricing tiers fit on a screen, where
a primary action anchors in scanning order, when a progress indicator
earns its place, why a settings list needs grouping.

## Perception and visual grouping

How the eye groups elements *before* the brain reads them.

- **Law of Proximity** (Wertheimer, 1923). Objects near each other
  read as a group. Cheapest grouping signal — cheaper than borders or
  shared color. Apply variable vertical rhythm: **8–12 px within a
  group, 32–48 px between groups.** Uniform spacing reads as nothing
  being grouped.
- **Law of Similarity** (Wertheimer, 1923). Visually similar elements
  read as a group. Equivalent affordances must share treatment — every
  list row identical class set, every secondary button identical, every
  destructive action identical. Visible deviation is reserved for the
  **one** item meant to draw attention.
- **Law of Common Region** (Palmer, 1992). A shared bounded area
  binds enclosed elements. Use enclosure when proximity isn't enough —
  and **reserve it.** Padding ≥16 px inside the region, distinct
  surface (border + tinted background, or card chrome at ≥1 px
  hairline). A page where every section is bordered destroys the
  signal.
- **Law of Prägnanz / Good Figure** (Wertheimer, 1923). The eye
  resolves complex layouts into the simplest underlying form. Designs
  aligning with a clear underlying grid (12-column, F-pattern,
  4-quadrant) feel inevitable; ornate breaks that add nothing semantic
  feel arbitrary.
- **Law of Uniform Connectedness** (Palmer & Rock, 1994). The
  strongest grouping signal in the Gestalt hierarchy: connected lines,
  shared toolbars, or bracketing containers tie items together more
  strongly than proximity or similarity. Use for wizard steps,
  comparison sets, and explicit navigation flows.
- **Selective Attention** (Broadbent, 1958). Cognitive bandwidth is
  finite. Users filter aggressively and ignore anything that looks
  irrelevant — banner blindness comes from this. Reserve the strongest
  visual contrast for the **single** goal-relevant action.
- **Von Restorff Effect** (von Restorff, 1933). The item that differs
  from a uniform field is the one most likely to be remembered. Make
  the recommended pricing tier, the active nav item, the warning state
  visually distinct. Pair contrast with a non-color signal.
- **Aesthetic-Usability Effect** (Kurosu & Kashimura, Hitachi Design
  Center, 1995). Visual polish biases perceived usability. Refined
  typography, generous whitespace, and a calm palette earn the benefit
  of the doubt for minor friction. **Never substitutes** for measurable
  usability or for state-coverage rules.

## Decision-making

How fast and how well users decide when an interface offers a choice.

- **Hick's Law** (Hick, 1952; Hyman, 1953 replication). Decision time
  grows roughly `log(n+1)` with the number of equivalent options. Cap
  any single decision-screen to **3–5 visible primary options**;
  collapse the rest behind progressive disclosure; visually distinguish
  the recommended choice. Aggressive truncation that hides the path
  forward is the opposite failure — surface the full option set, just
  don't render every option at the same visual weight.
- **Choice Overload** (Iyengar & Lepper, 2000). Too many
  roughly-equivalent options stall or abandon the decision. **Pricing
  pages: 3–4 tiers, exactly one marked recommended. Product grids:
  6–9 hero cards above the fold. Settings panels: ≤5 named groups.**
  Never a flat wall of equivalents.
- **Anchoring** (Tversky & Kahneman, *Science* 185:1124–1131, 1974).
  The first number a user sees re-weights every subsequent number.
  Place the recommended pricing tier where it anchors the comparison;
  render yearly-billing savings as concrete dollar deltas, not just
  percentage badges; pre-select the safer default in radio groups.
  **Visual weight matches intended decision weight.**
- **Pareto Principle / 80-20** (Pareto, c.1906; Juran, 1951). A small
  share of features drives most of the value. Identify the **2–3
  actions** that drive the dominant journey for the target persona;
  emphasize visually; demote the long tail to overflow menus, footer
  surfaces, or settings.
- **Tesler's Law / Conservation of Complexity** (Tesler, Apple,
  1980s). Every product has an irreducible amount of complexity. The
  design choice is *where* it lives — engineering team, interface,
  user — not *whether* to eliminate it. When complexity reaches the
  user, surface contextual guidance (tooltips, smart defaults, inline
  empty-state coaching, progressive disclosure) at the exact step
  where it surfaces. **Hiding it is not the same as removing it.**
- **Occam's Razor** (Ockham, 14th c.). Among options that explain the
  data equally well, prefer the one with the fewest assumptions.
  Specify constraints, not preferences. "Three tiers, one recommended,
  recommended sits center" beats "elegant pricing table".

## Memory

How users hold information across screens and sessions.

- **Miller's `7±2`** (Miller, *The Magical Number Seven*, 1956) /
  **Cowan's `~4`** (Cowan, *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*, 2001).
  Working memory is bounded. **Cap unrelated items at ~5 per group**;
  chunk longer lists into named groups. The modern conservative
  estimate is closer to 4 than 7 — when in doubt, chunk smaller.
- **Recognition over Recall** (Nielsen). Recognition beats recall:
  persisting prior context across screens, marking visited elements,
  and surfacing comparison views beats forcing the user to memorize.
  On dashboards specifically: sticky filter chips, last-N selections
  persisted, breadcrumbs that include applied filters.
- **Serial Position Effect** (Ebbinghaus, 1885). Recall favors the
  extremes — primacy at the start, recency at the end — while middle
  items fade. Anchor the most important nav items at the leftmost and
  rightmost positions of a horizontal menu; cluster utilities in the
  middle.
- **Peak-End Rule** (Kahneman/Fredrickson/Schreiber/Redelmeier,
  *Psychological Science*, 1993). Memory of an experience is dominated
  by the emotional peak and the ending, not the average. **Stage a
  high-effort celebratory success state; let intermediate steps stay
  calm.** Mediocre middles matter less than a strong close. The peak
  belongs at the *end* of a flow, not as arbitrary mid-flow motion.
- **Zeigarnik Effect** (Zeigarnik, 1927). Uncompleted tasks create
  cognitive tension that pulls the user back. Visible progress ("3 of
  5 steps", greyed-out next sections) converts that tension into
  completion pressure. **Reserve for genuinely beneficial flows like
  onboarding;** applying the same lever to streaks, daily-quest
  counters, or notification-reduction nags is a dark pattern.

## Interaction and motor

How fast and how accurately users can act on the UI.

- **Fitts's Law** (Fitts, *Journal of Experimental Psychology*, 1954).
  Time to acquire a target depends on its distance and size. **Bigger
  and closer is faster.** Spacing between adjacent hit zones matters
  as much as size. Pair with WCAG 2.5.8's `24×24 CSS px` AA touch-
  target floor; on mobile, place high-frequency controls in the
  natural thumb arc.
- **Doherty Threshold** (Doherty & Thadani, *IBM Systems Journal*,
  1982). **Sub-second feedback keeps users in flow; latency above ~1
  second breaks attention.** The implementable directive: no indicator
  under 300 ms; skeleton 300 ms – 2 s; labelled spinner 2 – 10 s;
  determinate bar with cancel 10 – 60 s; stop and offer error/retry
  past 60 s. (The 400 ms folklore figure does not appear in the 1982
  paper.)
- **Flow** (Csíkszentmihályi, 1975). Flow sits in the balance between
  challenge and skill — too hard breeds frustration, too easy breeds
  boredom. Continuous feedback and a clear sense of control keep the
  user inside the state. **System friction and latency are the fastest
  ways to break it.**
- **Goal-Gradient Effect** (Hull, *Psychological Review*, 1932).
  Motivation to finish rises as the goal gets closer. Multi-step flows
  render with a prominent progress indicator that reflects **real**
  endowed progress — show completed prerequisites when they truly
  exist (saved profile, imported team, prior survey answer). When no
  real prerequisite exists, render the current step honestly as `1 of
  N`. Hull's hypothesis is descriptive; treating it as license for
  fabricated progress, streak dark patterns, or loyalty-program quota
  inflation is a misread.
- **Postel's Law / Robustness Principle** (Postel, RFC 760, 1980). "Be
  liberal in what you accept, conservative in what you send." Take
  input in whatever shape users naturally give it (phone numbers with
  or without dashes, dates in mixed formats, percentages with or
  without `%`); normalize internally to a canonical form; emit one
  consistent format on output.

## Behavior and expectation

What users predict and how that interacts with the rendered surface.

- **Jakob's Law** (Nielsen, NN/g, 2000). Users spend most of their
  time on other sites and expect yours to work the same. **Reuse
  category convention** — nav placement, cart icon, settings gear,
  primary CTA in the upper right of a SaaS landing — so the user
  spends zero cycles relearning interaction grammar. Novelty must earn
  its keep against the convention's ROI; "innovate everywhere" is the
  opposite failure.
- **Mental Model** (Craik, 1943; Norman, *POET*, 1988). Every user
  arrives with a prior built from competitor products and the physical
  world. When the prediction holds, the product feels intuitive; when
  it breaks, friction shows up as confusion, not curiosity. When the
  brief names a reference product, anchor explicitly.
- **Paradox of the Active User** (Carroll & Rosson, 1987). Users skip
  the manual and start using the software immediately, even when
  reading would speed them up. **Bake guidance into the surface
  itself** — empty-state coaching, inline tooltips, contextual hints —
  at the action point.
- **Parkinson's Law** (Parkinson, *The Economist*, 1955). Work expands
  to fill the time allotted. Loose interfaces let users dawdle; cut
  friction and pre-fill what you can — autofill, smart defaults, saved
  state — so a checkout finishes faster than the user expected.
  **Beating anticipated duration becomes the felt win.**
- **Cognitive Load** (Sweller, *Cognitive Science*, 1988). Total
  mental effort splits into intrinsic (the task's inherent difficulty)
  and extraneous (poor layout, jargon, inconsistent patterns, visual
  noise). Designers can't reduce intrinsic load; they own extraneous
  fully. Single accent + three-weight typography + restrained anti-
  default list = constrained extraneous load.

## Folklore corrections

- "Anchoring effect = Tversky & Kahneman 1972." Wrong year. The
  *Science* paper introducing the anchoring framing is **1974**; the
  1972 paper is "Subjective probability: A judgment of representativeness"
  (different work).
- "Tesler's Law was developed at Xerox PARC." Tesler left PARC for
  Apple in 1980; the **Conservation-of-Complexity** formulation
  traces to his Apple years.
- "Paradox of the Active User was a CACM article." It's a chapter in
  Carroll's *Interfacing Thought* (MIT Press, 1987), not CACM.
- "Selective Attention = solved by red dots and badges." Repeated
  attention-grabbers train banner blindness.
- "Fitts's Law alone is enough for touch targets." Fitts gives the
  speed-accuracy tradeoff. WCAG 2.2 SC 2.5.8 sets the AA floor at
  `24×24 CSS px`; iOS HIG suggests `44×44 pt`; Material 3 suggests
  `48×48 dp`. **Fitts plus the platform floor — never just Fitts.**
